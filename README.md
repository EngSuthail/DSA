Welcome! This repository contains my personal solutions to algorithmic problems from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). 

I focus on writing clean, efficient **Java** code. Each file represents a single problem and includes the full solution along with my thought process.

## 📂 Repository Structure

All solutions are located in the root directory for easy access. 

- **File Naming:** `ProblemName.java` or `ProblemID_ProblemName.java`
- **Content:** Each file contains the `Solution` class, and I often include the *Intuition*, *Approach*, and *Complexity Analysis* as comments at the top of the file.
