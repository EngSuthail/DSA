/*
Intuiton - instead of finding the largest element using mergesort, which has higher time complexity, i thought to do a linear search
Approach - The problem stating that, largest element should be twice as other elements. So i found the second largest element in the array and checked whether 
the largest one is twice as the 2nd largest one
